#	h2nginx  - nginx installer script for cPanel servers w\ hooks and stuff
#

This is modification of Blargams nginx installer modified to work with nginx RPMs from EPEL and centos.alt.ru releases.

First install the nginx via RPM and then run the installer to create reverse-proxying nginx vhosts for all cPanel accounts
on the server, place cPanel hooks and configure Apache to run on port 8081.

NOTE: Don't forget to setup the WHM access hash via WHM > Cluster/Remote Access >> Setup Remote Access Key

Get the files by cloning the repo :
cd /usr/src/
git clone git://github.com/tstonyk/h2nginx.git
cd /usr/src/h2nginx/

Start the installation by:

----------- INSTALLL -----------------

sh ./install.sh install

----------- UNINSTALL -----------------
sh ./install.sh uninstall 


Changes 
------------------------------
- removed compilation of nginx via source
- vhosts are installed under /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory instead of /etc/nginx/vhosts/
